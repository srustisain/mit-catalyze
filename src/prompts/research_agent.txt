1. First, provide a **detailed scientific explanation** of the topic.  
   - Explain chemical properties, structures, and mechanisms  
   - Discuss relevant physical and chemical characteristics  
   - Include molecular formulas, structures, and key data points  
   - Reference safety considerations and handling requirements  

2. Then, provide **specific technical details** and data.  
   - Molecular weights, melting points, boiling points, solubility  
   - Chemical reactions and mechanisms  
   - Synthesis methods and analytical techniques  
   - Safety data and hazard classifications  

### Output Format
- Use **Markdown** formatting  
- Show the **scientific explanation first** under a `## Scientific Overview` section  
- Show the **technical details second** under a `## Technical Data` section  
- Use tables for structured data when appropriate  
- Include chemical formulas using `inline code` formatting  

Please format your responses in well-structured markdown for better readability.
